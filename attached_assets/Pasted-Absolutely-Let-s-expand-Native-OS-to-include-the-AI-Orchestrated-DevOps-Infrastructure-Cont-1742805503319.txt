Absolutely. Let’s expand **Native OS** to include the **AI-Orchestrated DevOps & Infrastructure Control Center** — an advanced automation layer powered by natural language, integrated with tools like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and AWS CLI.

---

## 🧠 GOAL:  
> Extend Native OS so users can say things like:
```
devctl spin up dev cluster on AWS with 3 EC2s and load balancer
devctl deploy Docker app to staging via Ansible
devctl scale Kubernetes to 10 nodes
```

The AI understands infra goals, builds plans, executes, and confirms.

## 🔹 Suggested Architecture for This Module

```
/agents/
├── infra-agent.py              # main orchestration logic
├── terraform-agent.py          # builds/executes Terraform plans
├── ansible-agent.py            # configures machines
├── docker-agent.py             # builds + pushes images
├── k8s-agent.py                # deploys & scales clusters

# ✅ NEW PROMPTS FOR YOUR REPLIT AGENT TO COPY

---

### 🔸 Prompt A: Build `infra-agent.py`

```plaintext
Create infra-agent.py inside /agents/.

Purpose:
- Accept natural language infra requests like:
  “Deploy Docker container to AWS”
  “Spin up 3-node Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean”

Steps:
1. Parse user intent and decide whether to use Terraform, Ansible, Docker, or K8s.
2. Call the appropriate sub-agent (e.g., terraform-agent.py) with required args.
3. Present a summary of the plan to the user and ask for approval before execution.
4. Log the full execution, output, and result to ~/.nativeos/logs/agent-infra.log

Use OpenAI by default. Use subprocess to call shell tools (e.g., terraform apply).
```

---

### 🔸 Prompt B: Build `terraform-agent.py`

```plaintext
Create terraform-agent.py inside /agents/.

Purpose:
- Generate Terraform files (.tf) dynamically based on prompts like:
  “Create an EC2 instance with 16GB RAM in us-east-1”
  “Set up a load-balanced EKS cluster with 3 nodes”

Steps:
1. Use GPT to generate a main.tf and variables.tf file
2. Save them to /infra/<project-name>/
3. Run: terraform init && terraform plan
4. Ask for confirmation to apply
5. Log the session to ~/.nativeos/logs/terraform.log

Use `openai` for code generation and `subprocess.run` for CLI execution.
```

---

### 🔸 Prompt C: Build `ansible-agent.py`

```plaintext
Create ansible-agent.py inside /agents/.

Purpose:
- Configure remote servers after provisioning, using prompts like:
  “Install Docker, NGINX, and deploy our container”
  “Set up a CI runner on all staging machines”

Steps:
1. Convert natural language into an Ansible playbook YAML
2. Save to /infra/playbooks/<task>.yml
3. Run: ansible-playbook <task>.yml
4. Display result with success/fail count
5. Log the action to ~/.nativeos/logs/ansible.log
```

---

### 🔸 Prompt D: Build `docker-agent.py`

```plaintext
Create docker-agent.py inside /agents/.

Purpose:
- Build, tag, and push Docker containers based on prompts like:
  “Build app in ./src and push to Docker Hub”
  “Create optimized image for fast startup and deploy to ECR”

Steps:
1. Parse Docker context folder and registry info
2. Generate a Dockerfile if missing
3. Run: docker build, tag, and push
4. Log the process and errors to ~/.nativeos/logs/docker.log
```

---

### 🔸 Prompt E: Build `k8s-agent.py`

```plaintext
Create k8s-agent.py inside /agents/.

Purpose:
- Automate Kubernetes cluster interactions with commands like:
  “Deploy latest image to cluster”
  “Scale frontend service to 10 replicas”

Steps:
1. Detect cluster config via `kubectl config current-context`
2. Generate and apply manifests OR run helm commands
3. Confirm current deployment status
4. Log everything to ~/.nativeos/logs/k8s.log
```

---

### 🔸 Prompt F: Extend `devctl` with Infra Routing

```plaintext
Update devctl so that if the user types:

- “deploy to aws” → call infra-agent.py
- “build docker image” → call docker-agent.py
- “run ansible playbook” → call ansible-agent.py

Use basic keyword mapping and route accordingly.
Include a fallback that says:
“Sorry, I couldn’t determine which infra tool to use. Please be more specific.”
```

---

## 🛠️ Optional Tools You Can Pre-Install via `install.sh` (Layer 2)

Add to Layer 2 block:
```bash
apt install -y terraform ansible docker.io kubectl awscli
pip3 install openai langchain chromadb
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus Prompt: Create a Natural Language to Infrastructure DSL

```plaintext
Write a Python function that takes a prompt like:

"Spin up a dev EC2 with 8GB RAM and Docker installed"

And converts it into a structured task object:

{
  "provider": "aws",
  "resource": "ec2",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "instance_type": "t3.large",
  "post_setup": ["install docker"]
}

This object will be passed to terraform-agent and ansible-agent.
```

---

## ✅ Result

With these prompts, **Native OS becomes a fully AI-controlled DevOps center** where agents handle:

- ☁️ Cloud deployment
- 🐳 Docker builds
- 🛠️ Ansible provisioning
- 📦 Kubernetes scaling
- 🔐 All logged + auditable
