# Native OS Platform Independence Update

This update removes all platform-specific dependencies and references from the Native OS codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Removed all configuration files specific to Replit environment
2. Updated project metadata in pyproject.toml
3. Ensured all agent code uses environment-agnostic paths
4. Updated GitHub repository with clean commit messages
5. Configured proper logging to ~/.nativeos/logs directory

## Running Native OS

The codebase is now completely platform-independent and will work in any standard Linux environment with:

1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. Required dependencies from pyproject.toml
3. Optional API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek set as environment variables

## Configuration

Native OS can be configured to use different AI providers by setting the following environment variables:

- OPENAI_API_KEY - for OpenAI API access
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - for Claude API access
- DEEPSEEK_API_KEY - for DeepSeek API access
- NATIVE_OS_DEFAULT_PROVIDER - set to "openai", "anthropic", or "deepseek" (defaults to "openai")
- NATIVE_OS_LOCAL_MODEL - set to "1" to use local Ollama model instead of remote APIs

If no API keys are provided, the system will default to using local Ollama models.
